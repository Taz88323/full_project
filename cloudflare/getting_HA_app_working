Opens in a browser but doesn't open in the app, which looks to be SSL related, so will need to create a certificate

$ openssl pkcs12 -export -out cfcert.pfx -inkey private.key -in cert.pem
Could not open file or uri for loading private key from -inkey file from private.key: No such file or directory

created certificate, which seems to have introduced more problems, can't access on browser or app
